			<h2> The Inverted Classic </h2>
			<p> The negative space is really the focal point of this version, as the blue torch really seems to pop out from the design. I think this version might actually work better than the regular Classic.  </p>

			<h2> The Light </h2>
			<p> The golden flame really takes the center stage in this version; this flag does a great job of capturing the hopeful American spirit that drew so many to its shores in the first place.</p>

			<h2> The Frame </h2>
			<p> In a mashup of the Inverted Classic and the Light, the torch seems to be spontaneously generating from the blueness of the frame in this version. I think it just looks cool.  </p>

			<h2> The European </h2>
			<p> As its name suggests, this version pays homage to New York's European heritage. The Cross of St. George in the background represents the state's history as an English colony, while the orange highlights allude to its Dutch roots (House of Orange). </p>
