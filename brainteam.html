		<h2 class = "abstract"> The team's logo had to a) be identifiable as "Ithaca" for tournaments, b) be identifiable as the "Brain Team" within the school, and c) establish a distinctive aesthetic for the team's overall brand. The final logo is the result of a balancing act between all three criteria. </h2>

		<h2 class = "abstract"> Ithaca High School hosts a Quiz Bowl tournament every November, and the 2019 tournament featured its own custom logo for the very first time. Autumn colors and geometric shapes worked in unison in to create this branding.</h2>
